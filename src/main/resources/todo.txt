You are continuing work on my IntelliJ plugin for the Arma Config language.
Please load everything you know about the project from memory and reset all short-term reasoning.

We are implementing a full IntelliJ language plugin with:
- custom lexer (ArmaConfigLexer.kt)
- GrammarKit BNF grammar (ArmaConfig.bnf)
- generated PSI inside src/main/gen
- syntax highlighter
- breadcrumbs
- custom color settings page
- more features to come

Here is the current TODO list (start with easiest to implement after reading the files I upload):

- I would like to have weak warnings on any , inside of any ()
- Add semantic check: array[] must match {} and vice versa.
- Fix Folding - It does not work currently

I will now upload the files you need. Please parse them and reconstruct the full plugin state before continuing.
